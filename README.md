### Guarded Trails: Crime informed navigation

Navigation systems are increasingly incorporating safety considerations to provide users with more secure travel options. The aim of our project is to develop a system that predicts the safest routes on maps by considering criminal activities along different paths to a given location. Such a safety conscious system can prove to be very beneficial for travelling at night or for courier deliveries etc. We investigate various open source datasets and popular algorithms to approach this project. The crime dataset for New York city is proposed to be selected for this implementation.
